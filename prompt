I have a react app and fast API backend.
In my react app, I have a table with manual backend pagination and filters, when a filter is applied, data will be fetched and updated in the table.
 
In backend, when call goes to API, I want to asynchronously do so other operation using the filter, store the processed the data from asynchronous processing in a TTL cache
 
In the UI, where I am showing the table, In that page there is another component, In that page I want to show the data from the TTL cache. To that component, I want to get that data from zustand store.
 
explain how I can achieve above. In most efficient way. Lets just discuss the approach. later we can get into impl.
concise.



So basically, the application helps the user track how a particular member moves through organisations over a period of time. This can be dependent on a few factors of the member like location etc.the application will show a set of tables from start to end showing how the member's organizations changed over a period of time.





Data Express UI

A centralized interface for Engagement Managers and Analysts to view organizational setup data, file delivery status, and file content.

Org Setup (Beta Testing Phase)

- Showcases file setup for an organization for a specific cycle. The module displays a table with key setup columns, offering filter and export capabilities.

SFTP Status (Development in progress)

- Track file SFTP delivery status, timestamp and SFTP tag information.

Data Analysis (TODO)

- View file data sent to organizations in a table, focusing on key data elements such as member ID and claim line ID.
- Role based access control enabled for Data Analysis.

Files Supported: Aetna Code, Attribution, Capitaton, Claim Diagnosis Crosswalk, Claims, Clinical Reporting Package, Commercial Gaps in Care, Delegation, Enrollment / COE6, FAQs, Lab Results, Medical Case, MORS-D, MORS-E-G, MORS-J, MORS-M, MORS-L, MA04, Patient Profile / ENROLL07, Pharmacy, Premium / MMR, Provider

Data Express ChatBot

- The system uses a multi-agent architecture, with specialized agents (PARM, FTP, QA) coordinated by an intelligent router powered by Gemini LLMs and LangGraph for stateful workflow orchestration.
- FAQ and documentation queries leverage RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with semantic search, storing vectorized embeddings in ChromaDB for efficient knowledge retrieval.
- The tech stack integrates Google ADK, LangChain, Vertex AI, and Streamlit, enabling enterprise-grade features like real-time data integration, context-aware memory management, and HIPAA-compliant security.
- The project is migrating its streaming and UI components from Streamlit to a modern React frontend and FastAPI backend for improved scalability and flexibility.
